\begin{abstract}
    \textbf{TikTok has become a dominant social network, and this work studies how users interact on the platform and with each other. This is achieved by creating a social network graph and studying cosine similarity to confirm the presence of echo chambers. Political orientation of users is inferred based on who they follow. Finally, the impact a viral video has on the number of followers is presented, and user engagement is analyzed and visualized.
