## Project Goals

The idea is utilize TikTok's official [APIs](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc) in order to study users behaviors and political positioning in the context of the next 2024 US presidential elections.

### Goal 1 : Social Graph

The idea behind a Social Network Graph is to clearly show relations (represented as edges) between users (represented as nodes). \
This is done in order to see how high is the degree of intersection between different political fields (or how low it is, leading to echo chambers), starting from "root" nodes represented by a list of selected influencer and moving on through their respective followers. 

Let's see an example: 
![social_graph_mocUP](../docs/images/san_moc.png)

We can clearly see the idea in action: user *@corylapen* represent an intersection between the user-bases of *@aoc* and *@huffpost*. In this case we do not have a bridge between two political areas (both these influencer are left-leaning) but its clear how this could be utilized.

### Goal 2 : Followers Region

It could be of interest to learn the followers nationality of our pool of influencers: this will allow us to either conjecture about possible outsider's influence, and to whom it is directed (left or right wing). \
This information can also be intertwined with data from both the social graph and the sentiment analysis, to get even more insights about the political landscape.

### Goal 3 : Video Comments Sentiment Analysis 

The idea is to use libraries and services from either R or AWS to do a sentiment analysis on the comments under the videos of our pools of influencers. \
We can then use this information to see if the user-base is aggressive or supportive and, provided more information about it, we can see if this has any correlation with the political orientation or nationality of the users.

### Goal n

TODO?
 
## Methodology  

First, two lists (left-leaning and right-leaning) of influencer have been compiled, in order to have two "pools" of data with a clear political orientation. \
This has been done to avoid creating the pools with automated tools, like ML or NLP, that have been deemed not precise enough. \
**TODO**
The influencer's handles used to gather data are summarized in the following list (EITHER the complete list can be found [here](https://github.com/albertomorini/CNS/blob/main/msc/handles.txt))(OR not all of the following handles have been used to gather the data presented in this report):
- Right: 
    - [@huffpost](https://www.tiktok.com/@huffpost)
    - @aoc 
    - tre
- Left: 
    - uno
    - due 
    - tre

### Social Graph

Starting from the influencers pool, we query their followers using TikTok's official [APIs](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/research-api-specs-query-user-followers/)

```python
def getFollowers(username,cursor):
    res = requests.post(TikTok_URLs['followers'],
    headers={
        'Authorization':'Bearer '+getAuthToken(),
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    data=json.dumps({
        'username': username,
        'max_count': 100, #Default is 20, max is 100.
        'cursor': cursor #NOTE: unix timestamp
    })
    )
    if(res.status_code==200):
        return res.json()
    else:
        writeLog('Error downloading followers, code: '+str(res.status_code),'ERROR')
        return None

```

## Results

### Social Graph

TODO \
a lot / not a lot of echo chambering 

## Extensions

### Social Graph

TODO \
- increase data layers 
    - influencer -> user follower -> user follower following -> repeat
- give node weight based on followers count
    - from user info

## Problems -> just put in methodolgy paragraph?

### Social Graph

TODO \
User pooling via official APIs:
- not truly randomic
- no transparency
- only 100 user per request -> per time stamp
