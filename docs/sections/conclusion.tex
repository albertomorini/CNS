\section{Conclusions}

While gathering data through TikTok's official APIs has proven difficult, the amount of total information ultimately obtained was satisfying: 35,798 distinct followers and 182 videos were downloaded among 10 selected super-users.

This dataset was used to visualize the network and identify the presence of echo chambers, numerically confirmed by the low cosine similarity between super-users, measure users' engagement, revealing higher participation by right-leaning accounts, and to demonstrate the impact a posted video has on both engagement and the number of followers.

Finally the information was utilized to develop a prototype for inferring political orientation, although the high degree of isolation mentioned before made it difficult to draw clear conclusions.
