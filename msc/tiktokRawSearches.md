began organizing paid influencers on TikTok and other social media platforms as early as 2020. Democrat-aligned PR firms such as Main Street One (now renamed People First) pioneered such tactics
Republican and Conservative hype houses on TikTok also campaign on behalf of political candidates. 
Influencer-driven marketing firms now claim to control massive, immediately-deployable, stables of small-scale influencers on behalf of a given campaign. These “nano” and “micro” influencers aren’t what most people think of when they imagine an influencer. Most aren’t celebrities, either online or offline. Instead, these are everyday people who have captive, intimate social media audiences who identify with demographics especially appealing to U.S. political campaigns: Latinos in South Florida, Black voters in Atlanta and college-educated women in the Rust Belt.

On TikTok, however, a large follower base does not guarantee visibility. Creators’ influence is based on the performance of individual posts. Therefore, creating viral content is the primary means for visibility and sociality
[The creators quoted in this study, however, described more instances of controversy due to the politically charged nature of their content]

use to find bigger videos -> typing any letter after pressing the ‘#’ key displays suggestions for the most popular hashtag (i.e., typing ‘f’ displays suggestions #fyp, #foryou, #foryoupage
use to find bigger videos -> they were posting or hashtags that were nonsensical, such as in the case of #xyzbca, a trending hashtag with over 1.5 trillion views as of October 2021
oss: #blacklivesmatter, While millions of videos included BLM hashtags, still more millions were examples of hashtag hijacking that had nothing to do with the cause.
some interviewees described strategies to reduce their visibility to avoid harassment, reports or shifts in content recommendations. For example, Damoyee (@damoyee) would deliberately interact with videos that aligned with her personal views to see more similar content and cause a knock-on effect of her content being seen by other like-minded users as well.
But [on] TikTok you can make 65 accounts and just comment whatever you want from all of them (Gabbi @fettucinefettuqueen).

For instance, Conover et al. (2011) analyzed political hashtags some weeks before U.S. congressional midterm elections and observed that retweets reproduce the known partisan split in the online world, while the mention network shows that ideologically opposed individuals interact with each other
The maximum geodesic distance (diameter) of the three networks is three, which means that a maximum of three steps is needed to cross the network. The average distance of the three networks is 1.5, indicating that the average distance between the users is 1.5 steps. Moreover, the average density of the three networks is 0.32. This shows that 32 percent of the total possible relations actually occur. Although the density in all the networks is low, the short distances make it possible to connect easily to others.

perceived simplification of politics (PSP)  certain functions of opinion leaders such as information and complexity reduction, providing orientation, or arousing interest for topics, particularly on social media, which is dominated by limited characters and visual content
frequency of exposure to influencers’ content is consistently related to PSP.
the surge in political interest in response to PSP happens simultaneously with an increase in political cynicism limate change has clearly marked the socialization of Generation Z (Andersen et al. 2021). Thus, a perceived higher comprehensibility of this topic may amplify young people's interest, although to the detriment of a swelling frustration with the political elite,

The 301 pieces of content were coded along the 35 variables by one of the researchers, he other researcher coded the 30 pieces of content as well to calculate the reliability between both researchers and check whether they understood the codebook in the same way. he relevant test of intracoder reliability showed a perfect reliability of 1 according to Krippendorff’s alpha for most variables. Only six of the variables scored below but still within the good or acceptable range (α ≥ .800 or, where tentative conclusions are still acceptable, α ≥ .667; Krippendorff, 2004, p. 241). The variable on the policy area in focus scored a Krippendorff’s alpha of .948, direct reference to one or more parties .934, density of entertainment .892, density of self-presentation .757, density of information .754, and the one on density of opinion scored the lowest with .737. Measured with a simple percentage of agreement (Holsti), density of opinion still reached 90% of agreement, and all other variables scored higher.

Political firms, mostly those aligned with Democrats and progressive causes, are increasingly turning to them in hopes of finding ways to reach Generation Z and non-English-speaking voters, according to researchers, and they represent a novel — and unregulated — way of promoting political messages

TikTok has tried to sell itself as a place for everything but politics. Since 2019, the company has banned paid political advertising on the site (“the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,”
62 percent of Republicans back a ban on the platform, while only 33 percent of Democrats feel the same

There is no Trump or Elon-like “main character” of TikTok who can twist the platform to their will with an errant statement or news announcement, just a sprawling ecosystem of creators all vying to worm their way into as many “For You” tabs as possible.
