began organizing paid influencers on TikTok and other social media platforms as early as 2020. Democrat-aligned PR firms such as Main Street One (now renamed People First) pioneered such tactics
Republican and Conservative hype houses on TikTok also campaign on behalf of political candidates. 
Influencer-driven marketing firms now claim to control massive, immediately-deployable, stables of small-scale influencers on behalf of a given campaign. These “nano” and “micro” influencers aren’t what most people think of when they imagine an influencer. Most aren’t celebrities, either online or offline. Instead, these are everyday people who have captive, intimate social media audiences who identify with demographics especially appealing to U.S. political campaigns: Latinos in South Florida, Black voters in Atlanta and college-educated women in the Rust Belt.

On TikTok, however, a large follower base does not guarantee visibility. Creators’ influence is based on the performance of individual posts. Therefore, creating viral content is the primary means for visibility and sociality

some interviewees described strategies to reduce their visibility to avoid harassment, reports or shifts in content recommendations. For example, Damoyee (@damoyee) would deliberately interact with videos that aligned with her personal views to see more similar content and cause a knock-on effect of her content being seen by other like-minded users as well.
But [on] TikTok you can make 65 accounts and just comment whatever you want from all of them (Gabbi @fettucinefettuqueen).

For instance, Conover et al. (2011) analyzed political hashtags some weeks before U.S. congressional midterm elections and observed that retweets reproduce the known partisan split in the online world, while the mention network shows that ideologically opposed individuals interact with each other
The maximum geodesic distance (diameter) of the three networks is three, which means that a maximum of three steps is needed to cross the network. The average distance of the three networks is 1.5, indicating that the average distance between the users is 1.5 steps. Moreover, the average density of the three networks is 0.32. This shows that 32 percent of the total possible relations actually occur. Although the density in all the networks is low, the short distances make it possible to connect easily to others.

Only six of the variables scored below but still within the good or acceptable range (α ≥ .800 or, where tentative conclusions are still acceptable, α ≥ .667; Krippendorff, 2004, p. 241). The variable on the policy area in focus scored a Krippendorff’s alpha of .948, direct reference to one or more parties .934, density of entertainment .892, density of self-presentation .757, density of information .754, and the one on density of opinion scored the lowest with .737.

## Similarities of nodes in networks
https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1353/paper_14.pdf \
[...]similarity measures between nodes in the network. Several similarity measures, described in the literature are surveyed here with the goal of providing a guide to their selection in various applications. 
### Edge similarity
set similarity provides the index of intersection of node parents (which are, of course among the neighbors) of the nodes being compared
### Global structure similarity
aim to evaluate the similarity between two nodes in the context of the whole network \
Salton Index, Jaccard Index, and Sorensen Index always have good performance. Cosine similarity computational complexity is very high to be applied to very large data

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222697773_Empirical_comparison_of_local_structural_similarity_indices_for_collaborative-filtering-based_recommender_systems 

Cosine index has high computational cost, so local structure stuff has been made: When the data is dense, the structure-based indices can perform competitively good as Cosine index, while with lower computational complexity. Furthermore, when the data is sparse, the structure-based indices give even better results than Cosine index. \
[*Sparsity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_network): *In network science, a sparse network has much fewer links than the possible maximum number of links within that network (the opposite is a dense network)* \
**Oss:** our network is greatly sparse: most nodes are linked only with one influencer. 

![sim indexes](similarity_indexes_comparison.png)

Generally speaking, the diversity decreases with the increasing of N or L (we have low N, L is recommendation film list)

![comp indexes](computational_time_indexes.png)

Salton Index, Jaccard Index and Sørensen Index, always have good performances unless the available information is too few, which may be caused by either the extremely sparse training set (i.e., small q) or the very few number of nearest neighbors (i.e., small N) \

#### Cosine similarity

Idea: consider each influencer as a vector of words:
```
influencer = ["follower1", "follower2", "follower3", ... ,"followerN"]
```

**Using lexical vectors:**

	print(descriptions)
	tfidf = TfidfVectorizer().fit_transform(documents)
	# Vectorizer returns normalized td-idf
	pairwise_similarity = tfidf * tfidf.T
	arr = pairwise_similarity.toarray()

#### Salton index

[Definition](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/730511/preferential-attachment-and-salton-similarity-in-directed-networks): number of common neighbors between two nodes divided by the square root of the multiplication of the degrees of the nodes

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/linkprediction/vignettes/proxfun.html#salton-index-cosine-similarity

1.2 Salton Index (cosine similarity) measures the cosine of the angle between columns of the adjacency matrix, corresponding to given vertices. This measure is commonly used in information retrieval.

$$s_{xy}=\frac{|\Gamma(x)\cap\Gamma(y)|}{\sqrt{k_x\times k_y}}.$$

```r
# R
# Function to calculate s_xy  
# where x, y influencers
calculate_s_xy <- function(x_neighbors, y_neighbors) {
  # x_neighbors: vector of neighbors of node x
  # y_neighbors: vector of neighbors of node y
  
  # Calculate the size of the intersection of neighbors
  intersection_size <- length(intersect(x_neighbors, y_neighbors))
  
  # Calculate the degree of nodes x and y
  k_x <- length(x_neighbors)
  k_y <- length(y_neighbors)
  
  # Calculate s_xy
  s_xy <- intersection_size / sqrt(k_x * k_y)
  
  return(s_xy)
}

# Example usage:
x_neighbors <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Replace with actual neighbors of x
y_neighbors <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)  # Replace with actual neighbors of y

s_xy <- calculate_s_xy(x_neighbors, y_neighbors)

## Sentiment Analysis 

### Polarization

https://medium.com/@schaider/graph-level-neural-networks-for-predicting-social-network-polarization-4916d9589ecc

Polarization is measured using the network disagreement index (NDI). Given a graph G = (V, E, w) and a *vector of opinions* x ∈ [0,1]ⁿ of individuals in V, the network disagreement index P(G, z) is defined as follows:

![measure pol](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*H50YDPIOAyONJeAcx1C5Pw.png)

[...]nodes were assigned initial opinions and bias levels. Let A be the adjacency matrix for our generated graph. For a given node i, its initial opinions xᵢ(0) are given by:

## Writing Numbers
https://www.scribbr.com/academic-writing/numbers/

 APA Style, one of the most common style guides used in academic writing.

In general,**words should be used for numbers from zero through nine, and numerals should be used from 10 onwards**. This is true for both cardinal numbers (e.g., two, 11) and ordinal numbers (e.g., second, 11th). However, there are some important exceptions to this rule.

Use numerals for numbers from zero to nine that are followed by a precise unit of measurement.
Examples:

> The samples measured 7 cm in diameter. (“cm” is a unit of measurement)

> But: These three samples were subjected to further testing.

Use words for any number that is used to start a sentence, with the exception of years.
Examples:

> Seventy-two thousand ink cartridges are sold every day.

> Nineteenth-century novels often feature complicated plot lines.

> But: 2008 saw record olive crops throughout the Mediterranean.

Use words for common fractions and set expressions.
Examples:

> According to the survey, two thirds of the employees are dissatisfied.

> Understanding the Five Pillars of Islam is a critical first step.

> The Fourth of July is traditionally marked by a firework display.


**Writing long numbers**

Longer numbers follow specific rules:

    Use a period to indicate a decimal point.
    Starting with 1,000, use commas to separate every three digits.
    Starting with a million, use a combination of numerals and words.
    Examples:

  > The region has an average of 43.75 doctors for every 10,000 people.

  > Some predict that the number of users will reach 2 billion by 2020.
